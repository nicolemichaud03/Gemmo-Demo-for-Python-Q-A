# Gemma Demo for Python Q&A
By Nicole Michaud
April 8th, 2024

This demo was created for the Kaggle competition "Google - AI Assistants for Data Tasks with Gemma".
In the notebook, I use Google's new open LLM model, Gemma, to answer common Python questions. 
The data I used to fine-tune this model for this purpose is from Python's FAQs page and contains 179 question-answer pairs and the categories they fall under.
